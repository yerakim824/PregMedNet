## Abstract
While medication intake is common among pregnant women, medication safety remains underexplored, leading to unclear guidance for patients and healthcare professionals. PregMedNet addresses this gap by providing an innovative analysis platform that systematically evaluates the impact of 1,152 maternal medications on 24 neonatal complications, leveraging data from over 1.19 million mother-baby dyads from U.S. claims databases. Advanced statistical methods were employed to control for selected confounders while preserving medication exposure data, robustly identifying 261 adjusted and 1,446 unadjusted odds ratios, capturing both confirmatory and novel associations. Systematic drug-drug interaction testing revealed five maternal medication combinations with significant neonatal effects. A knowledge graph approach further explored mechanisms behind newly identified medication-disease pairs. Notably, we experimentally validated the effect of maternal ondansetron on neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a novel interaction. These findings underscore PregMedNet’s potential as a valuable tool for guiding safer medication use during pregnancy, contributing to improved maternal and neonatal health.
